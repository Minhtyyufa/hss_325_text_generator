	In Kenneth Gross’s book, Puppet, he talks about the different types of puppets around the world and the traditions and meaning they bring along. Not only do we get a sense of the variety of what the puppet is used for but also what is a puppet. Like the world, nothing is ever black and white and there is never a right answer.
	To most people, a puppet is just an inanimate object that is used in children’s entertainment. However, puppets are more than that. Puppets are an ancient art with a vast amount of techniques and hold hundreds of years of history. The puppet basically becomes an extension of the puppeteer, exuding the wielder's thoughts and intentions. It pushes the boundary between life and death; even though puppets are inanimate objects, the puppeteer is able to give it life regardless of the limitations. When people think about puppets they usually imagine the typical ones of mariannette dolls or hand puppets. However, any object can be a puppet as long as the handler wills it to be, whether it be just forks or the puppet just has legs and arms. Kenneth Gross even says that even hands are puppets and the simplicity of nature - the absence of all the extra material a normal puppet may have - allows the audience to really focus on the message the puppeteer is trying to convey. I think this is an interesting point because it makes me wonder why. If anything can become a puppet is it through the sheer will power of humanity or by humanity’s creativity?
 The different types of puppets found around the world shows how humanity finds artful ways to express their culture and thoughts. Puppets have been around for an extremely long time in history and in all different parts of the world. It’s interesting to me how different yet similar the concepts are; similar in the sense that at some point puppets have been used as a form of expression. The differences reflect how the cultures are different and what the people performing the art value. For example, the puppeteers in Japanese bunraku are visible to the audience, but are turned invisible because their art overshadows them. However, they are fully willing to accept this and accept the puppets that are now living in “a world in which being manipulated is itself a condition of paradoxical freedom.” Nowadays, the word puppet has the associated connotation and assumption that means something that is manipulated. In a sense, the puppet has more freedom and the puppeteers have become more restricted in the movements they do; thus reversing the roles.
Free will has always been a concept that humanity has thought about. As there is the paradoxical freedom for puppets, we are similar in a sense. We may think we are in control because we decide what we can do, but we are restricted by things such as society. In the end we feel like we are the puppets and not the puppeteers, having our lives controlled and having life drag us forward. Puppets are restricted yet also extremely free. How I interpreted Gross’s concept of the puppet and the connection to the assumptions about the world was that this paradox is a reflection of how humans are living. Controlled yet have absolute freedom. What you think is not what is always the final answer.

	The last four chapters of Kenneth Gross’s book, Puppet: An Essay on Uncanny Life, talks about puppets in almost a darker nature. In the previous chapters, Gross writes how puppets are beautiful creations that have a life on their own. However, I felt uneasy while reading the final chapters. In chapter 8, Gross discusses, arguably, one of the most famous puppets - Pinnochio. Although most people are familiar with the name because of the classic Disney movie, the actual story is much darker. The story revolves mainly around poverty; both Gepetto, the puppet maker, and Pinnochio are poor and in constant hunger. Gepetto creates Pinnochio and immediately Pinnochio starts bullying Gepetto to get him food.
Gross questions “What is the nature of our desire, our appetite for the puppet, what do we devour with our eyes and ears and minds in watching these creatures? What do we feed on when we feed on them? And do they threaten to eat us in return? How are we devoured by the things we make? And when might that devouring itself save us?” This expands to more than puppets; some of our creations have us so fixated that we become consumed - not literally most of the time, but our time, thoughts, and life can be consumed. I’m not sure if being devoured by anything can ever save us. In the case of Pinnochio, even though he took everything from Gepetto, in the end Pinnochio saved him from the inside of the shark/whale, so I guess in the end what consumed Gepetto saved him.
I find it interesting how well Gross can compare puppets to humans and connect the ideals of puppets to those of the world. It makes me question if puppets are just that versatile or if Gross is creating themes in order to match a common idea in the world. Some of the things he says contradicts and seems very circumstantial. He says that puppets are life, but puppets also are death. He says that puppets are powerful, but puppets are also fragile. He then says the contrasting comparisons relate to how the world is, which never seems to be how it is. I feel like these kinds of answers are in a sense cheap. I know nothing can be black or white in cases like these, but it seems that anything can be the case if you reason hard enough. It seems as though you can twist the puppets in order to support your case. This may be the argument Gross was trying to convey all along: puppets can be manipulated as long as you know what you want as well as how to control the puppet.
Overall, I found the last few chapters a bit more interesting than the first seven chapters. However, I still am unsure what the entire point Gross was trying to get across in the book itself. Each chapter was about a different aspect of puppets and the only cohesive idea was puppets itself. In addition, there was no clear idea in each chapter because he says one thing and then will counter himself. If the book was to make me more creeped out about puppets, it has succeeded. If the book was trying to excite me and make me more interested in puppets, I say it has failed miserably. I can see the passion Gross has for this topic, but he should take a different approach to how he conveys it in my opinion.

	In highschool, we studied Freud along with a few other writers about psychoanalytics. I remember that I wasn’t a big fan of Freud’s work because I did not agree with what he explained; I understood his argument and even thought that it was a fascinating take on that subject matter. In the current times, people have realized what Freud talked about, which was once so revolutionary, isn’t as accurate (I distinctly remember reading a passage about women having penis envy and wanting to be males). However, after reading the “Uncanny,” it was interesting to see how different it was from the other pieces I’ve read.
	I found it interesting that he would go through the etymology of the word “Unheimliche.” It makes sense though because he mentioned that others have discussed this topic and mentions German psychologist Jentsch, so going from that standpoint looking at the origins of the word in the native language of the original writer. Even though in German “Unheimliche” and “heimlisch” are not directly opposite in words for all definitions, is that the case in all languages? I had that question in mind while first reading it and Freud actually did give examples of similar words in different languages, which I thought was very helpful.
	After reading Hoffmann's “The Sandman,” I felt like it would have been more interesting if he explored the Greek word for “uncanny.” Reading the story reminded me of the Greek mythologies and stories where they would hear their future from an oracle and spend the rest of their lives trying to prevent the future they were told. However, in trying to prevent the future from happening they end up causing it to occur thus fulfilling the prophecy. “The Sandman” is not quite the same but it has a similar theme; what Nathanael tried so hard to avoid since his childhood, comes back in the future and ultimately becomes his demise. The story fits well with Freud’s definition of uncanny that the familiar things that have been repressed while the person is younger turns into something strange in the future.
	I wonder when Freud says that the return of something familiar becomes strange does he mean it’s strange because we are comfortable with the idea because we had seen it before but also uncomfortable because we cannot remember it exactly since those thoughts have been repressed for a long time? Freud talks about the uncanniness of the “evil eye,” which relates to the principal of mind called the “omnipotence of thoughts.” So Freud says that the uncanny triggers primitive memories of animistic and spiritualism mental life. It makes sense that past repressed memories will resurface into something different later on in life. I wonder if there's a word for it. It is common for people to have irrational fears because they experienced a horrific event in the past that traumatized them - even forgetting the event because it was so traumatic. I guess that’s how the mind works and how life works. If you try to repress something and hide it away, it eventually comes back out whether you like it or not.

	“The Defecating Duck, or, The Ambiguous Origins of Artificial Life” by Jessica Riskin was an amusing read. I didn’t think one of the most important beginning automatons would be a pooping duck. While reading about the duck it reminded me about a current (?) child’s toy which was a baby that had to be taken care of. The “baby” would cry and ask to be fed and once you give the baby the “food,” after a little bit of time it would “poop” and you would have to clean up the mess. I see it isn’t a recent idea, but one that has been present for a long time. I especially found it funny when the reading said the person using the defecating duck had to prefill the duck with fake poop before using the machine.
	I wonder why Vaucanson chose to create a duck - especially a pooping duck. The reading mentioned several other models of birds that were created that the duck was compared to. There was an owl that just turned its head and looked at other birds and a swan that swam in the lake. Did they choose to create automatic birds because their anatomy was the easiest to replicate? Also a trivial question, are the exterior of the birds covered in feathers to make it as realistic as possible or is it just metal painted in a similar manner. Also for the pooping duck, is that the only action it can do? Looking at the diagram that explains its anatomy it doesn’t look like there are any mechanics to allow the duck to move its feet.
	I found the reading pretty interesting and enjoyed reading the history and reading about the progress people had made on automatons. The next machine the reading talked about was the flute player, chess player, and then silk maker. I had played the flute for all of high school, so I was pretty impressed when I read the mechanisms for the “flute player.” I remember it taking me a few weeks to learn how to actually blow into the flute itself to create a noise - my lips had to be in the right position and depending on how I positioned them I could change the sound. I know in the reading it mentioned how the different breathes were changed - a slower “breathe” would mean a lower note and etc. However, I’m still unsure about how they blew air into the flute itself. I get that the reading isn’t supposed to be a technical paper that thoroughly explains how each of the mechanisms works, although it provides nice diagrams and explains how they work well, but there are some aspects of the machines I’m a bit confused about.
	The reading was pretty enjoyable, and I really liked reading about the evolutions of machines. It’s always interesting how living things are always the source of inspiration. Is it the human’s desire to improve life that they always try to create automatons of living creatures. It kind of makes sense because a lot of new technologies take nature as their source of inspiration. Nature has thousands of thousands of years of evolution, which means they’ve already gone through the design process many times to perfect the design. But why did they choose a pooping duck? I”ll never understand.

	As mentioned in class, reading Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” was extremely confusing. The language itself was not hard to follow, but it was hard to figure out what Haraway was trying to do throughout the writing. What really confused me was the choice of the title of the paper itself. The dictionary definition of the word “manifesto” is a public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate. To my understanding a “cyborg” is a fictional character that has enhanced capabilities due to the fact that technology has been placed within its body. The ideas that Haraway writes about seem to be of a serious matter, but looking at the title of the paper I would have expected something of fiction.
	The title of the paper insinuates, in my mind, that the paper will be about the policies of cyborgs and that a cyborg or someone with very strong feelings about cyborgs wrote the paper. In the Communist Manifesto, it talked about the idealisms of communist and such, which is why I thought this paper was going to be about it. Now throughout the paper Haraway DOES talk about cyborg politics and the technology of cyborgs, but Haraway seems more focused on the idea of feminism. Haraway states, “Feminist cyborg stories ahve the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control.” She presents the ideas of the cyborgs to present her case about issues of feminism.
	She brings up the point that the views of traditional feminism usually have the assumptions all men are one way and women are another way. But “a cyborg theory of wholes and parts,” and Haraway suggests that feminists should move beyond naturalism and essentialism. It seems as though Haraway wants to present her criticisms about feminism, especially the Western patriarchal ideas and specifically white feminism. I’m not sure why she tries to pass it off as a paper about cyborgs, maybe the paper was used to get the attention of people due to the interesting title and then link the ideas back to feminism - a literary catfish.
	I guess Haraway wishes that the world were made up of cyborgs because there would be less sexism. She states that she wants to move away the patriarchal system and toward “the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender.” What is interesting is that she calls a world without gender “monstrous,” but it is something she wants. Does she truly want that kind of a world or is she using that word sarcastically because she knows most viewers won’t have the same ideas as her. It’s also interesting that nowadays there has been a bigger shift and encouragement against the two traditionally defining genders. Some people may think a world without two genders is a monstrous world, but Haraway would be happy to know that the current world has made the progression that she pushes for throughout the “Cyborg Manifesto.”

	After reading Despina Kakoudaki’s “Anatomy of a Robot,” it made me think why humans were always so obsessed with automating everything. I wonder if it was the desire to “play God” and recreate what already exists or the desire for efficiency. As civilization continued there has always been a technological progression: as people learned more, technology advanced, which promoted and allowed people to do more research. As most students were taught in middle school history, there were several industrial revolutions around the world. People were able to transition from manual labor to automating everything with machines to cheapen the costs but increase profit. Humans are always looking for things to make things easier with less work, which is why I wondered if it is because of the efficiency aspect.
	In the past reading of the “Defecating duck,” we read about several past machinery that were made to imitate a few simple tasks such as a defecating duck, breathing lungs, a flute player, etc. So even in the past, humans tried to recreate nature. Maybe it is a survival instinct that people have inside them; they know as technology grows, one day it will become so advanced that it will take over so they themselves have to become one with the technology - a very crazy theory that I had come up with while reading the passage. Towards the end of the paper, it mentioned how Aristotle said there were three distinguished “kinds of motion in human and animal body, and they are surprisingly consistent with the mechanical body fantasies of contemporary popular culture.” I wonder if these are observations that he had watching humans and automatons or if he was purposefully trying to find connections. In most cases, if someone tries hard enough to find similarities, they can very much do so by stretching the truth a little bit and providing evidence. People can easily be convinced if you give them a logical enough explanation.
	One aspect of the paper that I really enjoyed was how the paper mentioned pop culture references and included popular movies that had representations of artificial intelligence and human-like robots. Oftentimes, the media reflects what the vast majority of people perceive something to be OR the reason why the vast majority of people believe something that is true. For example, the popular kids cartoon Bugs Bunny widely spread the “fact” that rabbits/bunnies love to eat carrots when in fact they usually don’t. The movies produced can easily show mechanical robots in a bad light, which would cause a mass panic and everyone to fear robots. However, there are many movies that show the beauty of technology and the possibilities that can come from it, which may be one of the reasons people are so fascinated by them. We see the technology that could possibly be real in movies such as IronMan, which may inspire people to try and recreate it. I wonder why humans are fascinated with technology because maybe it's just in human nature to become curious and want to learn and create more.

	In all three of these readings, the main concept was that people think that making robots give them unlimited labor. In a way that does make sense because robots have no soul and can work as long as people program them to do tasks and supply the electricity. In “Surrogate Humanity,” the reading talks about the underlying racism that is associated with robots. For most of history, white Angelo Sax people have been enslaving people of the “lesser race” as slaves in order to increase the profits by cutting out paying the hard labor. Even though there are some delunsionalists that believe that by creating robots, it would help the economy and help the poor, increasing the number of robots in production most likely will do the opposite. Looking at what type of people usually do manual labor in factors, we see that a lot of times it’s the poor and uneducated. With robots doing their job, it essentially takes away those jobs and their only means of earning money. Even though the factory owners gain a lot of profit, the workers themselves become poorer and enlarging the difference between the rich and the poor.
	It seems like greed is a huge factor in why humans push themselves to build robots to become more efficient. In “Rossum’s Universal Robots,” the factory owner keeps pushing for more production of robots because it would bring a higher profit even when everyone is aware that a robot revolution may be approaching. What is confusing is that, if there are robots to do all the work in the world why is there  still a need for money? Money is exchanged for labor and goods in order to have a fair trade. If robots can do all the work for us, why bother with the whole capitalistic world? In my opinion, it is because people are greedy and materialistic. The rich don’t want to give up being rich and their privileges. This makes sense because if people did, we would be able to have a functioning communist community - but we all know that communism only works on paper.
	Reading “Rossum’s Universal Robots” also brings me back to the idea that people just like playing God. They want to be the creator and essentially have control over everything, which is one of the reasons that robots are made in the first place. I mentioned this idea in one of the other responses I wrote - I think about the “Defecating Duck.” It is a bit humorous to me that in the story the first person to make robots similar to humans did so in spite of God and to prove that he could do something similar and create life. It’s a little ironic to me that they spent so much time and effort into creating robotic life, that eventually they take away their own ability to create life naturally - by birth. I guess maybe they don’t consider giving birth to be creating life otherwise they would be satisfied and not need to create robots.
	Other than the extremely odd fixations from some of the characters in “Rossum’s Universal Robots,” the play has a lot of sexist undertones, which was quite unpleasant to read about. Helena always gets rebuffed and no one listens to her because she is a woman. Domin practically demands that she marries him and ultimately causes the downfall of the humans because of his selfish choices.

	After reading “Dying Drone Labor, War and the Dehumanized,” I immediately thought of the movie “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.” The Winter Soldier is one of the Marvel movies, and the story plot (in a condensed form) is that after extracting data that the protagonists discover that there is an active supercomputer that contains the preserved consciousness of an old enemy. The supercomputer has been slowly intfultrating and operating since after World War II. The protagonists discover that the operation that the supercomputer has been secretly running has developed a data-mining algorithm that can identify individuals that prove to be a threat. The rest of the movie is spent trying to prevent the algorithm from being used because there are air crafts - basically huge drones - ready to fire at the potential threats. This reminded me of the reading because of the similarities. An aircraft is used to determine potential threats and then used to gun them down to get rid of them before they can do any “harm.” The people don’t get a say whether this should be allowed; and there will be no warning, just an attack.
	The difference between the two is one is a movie and the whole situation is run by the “bad guys” of the movie. However, the reading is about the real world where it is our government who is sending out these drones on innocent people. The people they’re targeting MAY be a potential threat but they aren’t holding a trial to condemn them, they’re just sending out drones to kill them. What’s also worse is that they’re racist and targeting people of color. Does the government think that they’re superior and can do anything they want because they have the military capacity? It usually ends up with the stronger ones attacking the weaker ones. However, how does the military identify the threats? Do they have an algorithm? Do they have a database full of faces? Will this justify hate crimes if word gets out and people take things matters into their own hands? There are currently many hate crimes occurring with little incentive; if some people hear that the government is targeting “suspicious people,” they’ll take the opportunity to do even more harm and say they were just trying to help.
	It surprises me and really doesn’t surprise me how much the government is allowed to get away with. There has always been issues with corruption and military power abusing the third world countries while they’re there at war to “help them.” I don’t have the knowledge to know if what the government is doing is completely legal, but maybe the law doesn’t apply to them because they’re military. It makes me really question how much we should really trust our government and if there is any government that would be trustworthy. The drone’s situation seems pretty similar to the cold war, where there was a standoff between nations at the thought of one country blowing the other up. Essentially with drones this could happen again. Drones were a potential idea for faster deliveries until some people abused the system and tried to use the drones to attack others. Now the military is doing the exact same thing and most people aren’t away and/or not saying anything. I know in the reading they have art exhibits to make people aware but to be honest, I didn’t know about the situation so I’m not sure how much of the world is aware either.

	Reading the chapter, “A visitation” was quite disturbing; I honestly never knew that such places existed. I understand where people are coming from because death is scary and if there is a prospect of living forever, if one has the means to do so, then they should. I wonder how the technology to preserve the bodies work because technically the “patients” do not have a guarantee of eternal life. I feel like the housing system is selling a false belief to the people; the majority of the people who choose to become patients in this facility are worried about death and want to live forever. However, the patients who are admitted to the facility are already dead and just preserved for “forever” until there is the technology that allows them to be resuscitated. That is hoping that there is the technology to bring people back to life. It’s ironic that people always try to make robots more human-like and make humans more robot-like. What is the goal? For humans to live forever and not have to do any of the work? That seems like a very capitalist idea because the rich will be the only ones who have the means to live forever (as we see in the chapter it costs a LOT of money).
	The second chapter “Mere Machines,” I did not enjoy reading. It honestly made no sense, and I didn’t have a clear idea on what the chapter was about. At least in the first chapter it was about the facilities that would house people’s bodies until there was future technology to bring them back alive. The second chapter was maybe about the existence of robots? There seemed to be a lot going on in the chapter, including mentioning several movies that centered around robots and robots that were built to do a specific function such as provide emotional support. Something that was interesting to me was his statement that he has never seen a robot in real life. If he is thinking about the stereotypical robots in the media that look and talk like humans there are already a lot that exist. It may not be in the form he expects, but most people who have smartphones - specifically apple and samsung phones - have built in “assistants.” Apple/iphones have Siri and Samsung phones have bixby. These assistants can talk to them and have a full conversation. There are many videos of people having funny conversations while talking to their assistants.
	It is always fascinating how far technology has come and it makes sense why people have the mixed reaction of fear, awe, or curiosity. Technology has come so far that maybe it is possible for humans to live forever and for robots to one day become extremely realistic. A lot of past papers that were written as satire write about similar events that now only happen. Even though some things may sound far-fetched now, it may come true in the future.
