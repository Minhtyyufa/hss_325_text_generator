In Puppet: An Essay on Uncanny Life by Kenneth Gross, the deathly and uncanny nature of puppets and how people relate to them is discussed. He also describes the physical and spiritual liveliness of puppets. While the deathliness and liveliness of puppets seems to be contradictory, Gross sees this as a reflection of humanity. The paradox of uncanniness with physical and spiritual perfectness directly relates to the realities of humanity.

In chapter 1, “A Conversation in Rome”, Gross describes a puppet shop which contains cases of old toys and puppets. The scene he describes shows how “the puppets and toys in the gallery have their own haunted presence” (pg. 22). These puppets which belonged to dead children, now represent their ghosts, holding “secrets” from previous lives.

Gross describes a puppet whose pointed ears and beard give it the quality of a demon, but whose robe gives it the quality of a prophet. This “prophet-demon” (pg. 24) exhibits the conflicting qualities which may also be the essence of humans. The illusion of the most perfect and imperfect being all tied into one, may be appealing to people because of its similarity to the world. The world is filled with conflicting people and each person has inner conflict as well. Therefore, the nature of puppets closely resembles the nature of humans. Because of this, it is assumed that people will relate to a puppet as a being.

In chapter 3, “The Scale of the Puppet”, Gross describes the way the physical scale of a puppet, as compared to humans, is used to appeal to certain human emotions. Gross explains that some puppets are miniature, some are larger than life, and some have disproportionately sized limbs and facial features. It is ironic that these forms which do not look human are actually used to represent the most human of qualities. Perhaps it is not ironic, as these paradoxes are intended to highlight these qualities. For example, Gross writes that “[t]his theater can show us the cogitations of a man with no head” and  “the concert of a harpist without hands” (pg. 43). However, Gross continues by saying that these “plays of scale” are about something beyond the visual oppositions. He says that these paradoxes “suggest that we do not yet know the dimensions and limits of what we call life” (pg. 47). This assumes that humanity as a whole is unsure of its direction and will relate these visual representations to the conflict in their own lives. Again, the contradiction which is at the very nature of people allows the puppet to portray new ideas through theater.

In chapter 5, “Wooden Acting”, the idea of a puppet possessing a soul is introduced. A marionette moves with a grace greater than that of a human because of the inability of the puppeteer to control the exact motion of each limb. The “puppet’s soul is found… in its merely physical center of gravity” (pg. 63). Gross believes that when puppets fall into a state of grace, they are simple and innocent. They are more than human. When humans try to achieve a similar state they “become more dead” (pg. 63). Puppets then represent a quality which humans cannot achieve.

 Gross assumes that people will succumb to the physical and spiritual aliveness of a puppet as it performs, despite their quality of death. Humans can feel a realness to these supposedly inanimate figures. He implies that when people observe puppets, they attribute human qualities to them, placing them on a similar level, or on an even greater level than humans.

However, the uncanny quality of a puppet still exists. It seems to me that in order for a person to appreciate the perfectness of a puppet, one needs to look past the uncanniness. The effectiveness of puppet theater to convey paradoxes of life and realities of the world relies on the imagination of people. It relies on the assumption that people will see a reflection of themselves in puppets and puppet theater. People are simultaneously repulsed by and drawn to puppets because of the similarity of conflict between a human and a puppet.

While Gross understands the uncanniness of puppets, he believes that they simultaneously represent grace, perfectness, liveliness. He believes people can be moved by these lifeless beings coming to life. It may be the uncanniness itself that draws people in, thus allowing the puppets to convey real messages about life through theater.


In Puppet: An Essay on Uncanny Life by Kenneth Gross, the author describes the puppet Pinocchio and his adventures. The way Pinocchio transforms into other beings and his lack of need for food highlight the superhuman qualities of puppets. The relationship between a puppeteer and his puppet reveals a metaphor which explains how a puppet comes to life.

It is interesting to say that a puppet is beyond human, more than perfect. However, one aspect that may cause this assessment is that the puppet takes on many forms. It can move its limbs in ways that humans cannot. It can physically transform its body and face. In the stories about Pinocchio, which are talked about in chapter 8, the wooden puppet becomes “Pinocchio-Jonah” (pg. 104). A monster confuses Pinocchio for a “puppet-fish” (pg. 103) which he could eat. In another story Pinocchio turns into a “puppet-donkey” (pg. 103). Not only does an otherwise lifeless puppet come to life, but it comes to life each time in a different form. The puppet is in that sense a being greater than humans.

Another way in which we see the puppet exhibit beyond human qualities, is through its relationship to hunger and eating. Every time Pinocchio tries to eat, the food eludes him. He never actually ends up eating and remains hungry. However, “this hunger never weakens the puppet or threatens him with death; rather it renews his energy” (pg. 103). There is a paradox here because hunger is a human quality, however the ability to go without food is beyond human. The idea that a puppet can be a lifeless being, human and more than human all simultaneously shows in itself that puppets have greater capabilities than humans, at least regarding the forms which it takes on.

How does a puppet come to possess this ability? It is as if the hand of the puppeteer literally hands over a piece of life into a body. One can imagine a person breathing life into a wooden skeleton. As the puppeteer reaches into the body of a puppet, he places a soul inside. However, it is not like fire which spreads and grows, it is like removing a part of oneself and giving it to the object. In a twist of events, the puppeteer becomes a subject of the puppet.

While the puppet has capabilities that are greater than those of humans, puppets represent very human emotions and struggles. Chapter 11 discusses the innocence of a puppet. The puppet can do violent things but still be seen as innocent. For example, when Pinnochio ravenously tries to steal food, it is not his fault. American puppet artist Janie Geiser says that “no one blames the puppet for its violence, and no one quite blames the puppeteer” (pg 141). This statement shows the uncertainty around the idea of who is in control of the puppet’s actions. Is the puppeteer forcing the puppet to say and do what he wants? Or, does the “soul” of the puppet take over once the puppeteer relinquishes a part of himself to the puppet?

The innocence of the puppet suggests a level of awareness that is beyond what one might think capable of a puppet. Innocence “allows for a terrible fearlessness in the face of death” (pg. 142). Perhaps the puppet is fearless because it knows its body can drift between life and death whenever the puppeteer decides to pick it up. This idea that a puppet knows it is in some way invincible, is a quality that is beyond human as well.

Is this a false innocence? Is the puppet truly invincible or is it possible for a greater being to destroy it? This comes back to the question about the liveliness of a puppet. Is it alive? Is it simply a carved piece of material?

The puppet fragilely walks the line between living and lifeless. We can’t really say between life and death, because death implies a history of once living. It seems like the transformation from a lifeless being to a puppet with a soul happens as the audience falls into a state of mesmerization. The imagination of the audience becomes susceptible to the liveliness and ideas put forth by the puppet. Gross writes that “There is a moment when this lifeless object seems not just moved but self-moving” (pg. 163). This moment is where the transformation occurs. It is not something definite but something that changes for each person and for an audience as a whole. The greatest ability of the puppet which is in its own way more than human, is its ability to capture an audience and convey the illusion of life.

The Sandman by E.T. A. Hoffman is undoubtedly uncanny in nature. However, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what aspect makes this story uncanny. By reading this story alongside, The Uncanny by Sigmund Freud, perhaps it is possible to uncover the source of uncanniness.

In The Sandman, Nathaniel is constantly afraid of the Sandman whom his mother tells him is coming every night and whom he is told steals the eyes of children. This is definitely a scary idea for a child to believe and it sticks with him throughout his life. But as Freud distinguishes between uncanniness and fear, the question is: Is Nathaniel repulsed by an uncanniness about the Sandman and others, or is he merely afraid of the capabilities of those people? It would not be surprising if Nathaniel was scared of a person stealing eyes. However, it seems like the sense of uncanniness is first present when Nathaniel hears the footsteps of a man, believing that it is the Sandman. It is this moment of the Sandman coming to life, and no longer being a story, where fear transforms into uncanniness.

When Nathaniel believes to have discovered that the Sandman is Coppelius, a repulsive man who takes pleasure in children’s discomfort, the transformation continues. The idea of a monster in a story is scary, but a real person inside of Nathaniel’s house, hurting his father and stealing children’s eyes, is uncanny. When Nathaniel makes this discovery, Hoffman writes that “the Sandman was no longer the bogy of a nurse's tale, who provided the owl's nest in the crescent moon with children's eyes. No, he was a hideous, spectral monster, who brought with him grief, misery and destruction - temporal and eternal - wherever he appeared'' (pg. 3). When a figment of imagination becomes a person in the flesh, the fear transforms into uncanniness.

At the beginning of the story, it is difficult to understand if the events were real or perhaps taking place in Nathaniel’s dreams. This must be the way it seemed to Nathaniel. The state between alive and dead, awake and asleep, has an uncanny sense about it. Freud writes that “intellectual uncertainty whether an object is alive or not, and when an inanimate object becomes too much like an animate one” (pg. 8-9) can be the source of uncanniness. It is disorienting and discomforting to be in such a state where feelings, perceptions, understandings are constantly changing. Nathaniel has fits of fear and times of calm. He is so certain at times about reality, although he is often wrong. The Sandman and all that he encompasses for Nathaniel is a constant source of paranoia for him.

From Clara’s point of view, it is probably uncanny and unsettling to observe Nathaniel as hysterical and unstable. As Nathaniel read a poem that he wrote about Coppelius, Clara begged him to throw it away. Then Nathaniel pushed Clara and shouted, “Oh, inanimate, accursed automaton!” (pg. 10). He was so engrossed in his fascination with the Coppelius that when Clara saw the whole idea as a figment of his imagination, Nathaniel refused to believe she was even human. This is ironic because the Sandman, of whom he is so afraid, may not have been a living being at all. In that moment Nathaniel felt that Clara was incapable of empathizing with him.

Clara wouldn’t sympathize with him because she believed that Nathaniel was merely imagining the Sandman. She said, “as you believe in him, he really exists and exerts his influence; his power lies only in your belief” (pg. 8). Whether or not this is true, perhaps Nathaniel wanted to believe in the Sandman. It sounds illogical, but it seems like uncanniness draws people in. People can become fascinated with the repulsive. This, to me, is the difference between fear and uncanniness, to which Freud refers. Rather than pushing the Sandman, Coppelius and Coppola out of his mind, as one may do with frightening subjects, he becomes obsessed with interacting with them. He is constantly controlled by the space they encompass in his mind.

Through the story of The Sandman and the analysis of Freud, the meaning of uncanniness becomes more apparent. The uncertainty of reality, the sense that the Sandman is real and the belief which Nathaniel ascribes to the Sandman all create a sense of uncanniness and deep fear in Nathaniel’s mind. There is much more to the topic, but generally uncanniness is greater than a simple fear. It is a distortion of the truth and a power that a person cannot necessarily control.

Much of what interested me while reading about these different automatons and machines was the mechanical/electrical aspect of them. Riskin remarks, “To a twenty-first-century electrical engineer or computer scientist, Poe’s logic is perplexing.’ Why must a machine carry out only a predetermined sequence of moves? Why could it not respond to each move of its opponent as it went along?” (622) When I read this statement, I could not agree more with Riskin. A class that all electrical engineers are required to take before they can graduate from Cooper is called Stochastic Processes, and essentially this is a class in how to deal with data/games that seem to have infinite possibilities or are essentially random. Within this class and even in my senior project, an algorithm known as stochastic gradient descent is used with the capability of continuously responding to changes in real time. This is one of the feedback algorithms that is referenced, but it is common knowledge today. As a result, it got me thinking about the current difference between our most modern machinery and the human brain. We already have well researched machine learning and AI technology; simple mobile games already have Youtube videos in which machines are able to play them better than people do. Within the technological side, I would say the only difference between the human brain and an artificial one at this point is the efficiency in which the human brain is able to adapt and learn. Skill in a particular subject or knowledge is no longer a differentiation between the human and the automaton.

The idea that humans should/are different from machines is also not as simple as it seems. Riskin continues about the categorical difference between humans and AI saying:

“The driving force behind the projects of artificial life was the assumption that life could be simulated and that the simulations would be useful by being analogous to natural life, not by being its antithesis. So these categories really redefined one another, not only by opposition, but also by analogy, and the early history of artificial life was driven by two contradictory forces: the impulse to simulate and the conviction that simulation was ultimately impossible.” (631)

The line of thinking here started all the way with the controversy around the defecating duck; it could digest, but not yet like a human. We’re already at the point where robots can do many different activities better than the human, but in the case that this simulation of the human is complete as that pride will be impossible. Sometimes, we even require machines to do “human things”. Artificial insemination is an area where some humans require modern technology to do arguably the most human of things, reproduce. If technology can do something like this, maybe technology will get to a point where it is indistinguishable from the human. How we treat each humans and other technology at that point will be an interesting philosophical argument.

In The Defecating Duck, or, the Ambiguous Origins of Artificial Life by Jessica Riskin, the nature of mechanical automata and their relation to living beings is discussed. Some examples including the Duck, the Flute Player and the Turk help reveal some qualities that contribute to the essence of a living being through analysis of these automata.

The Duck, created by Jacques Vaucanson, is a mechanical automaton that mechanically eats and digests food. The Duck was able to eat grains of corn and then “digest” them so that they are ground up and released from the duck. While the system appeared to replicate a working digestive system, the duck actually had different grains being released rather than the actual grains that were “eaten” by the duck. However, from the outside perspective, the Duck appeared to simulate the inner workings of an actual duck. Riskin writes that 18th century mechanicians created devices that “emitted various lifelike substances; not only did their machines bleed and defecate, but, as we will see, they also breathed” (pg. 606). The Flute Player, also created by Vaucanson, is a mechanical system which allows the figure to blow into a flute with varying blowing pressure, aperture shape and note length. The flute player seemed lifelike as it played its instrument.

The descriptions of these automata reminds me of the movie The Bicentennial Man, starring Robin Williams. In this movie, which is based on the book by Isaac Asimov, a robot slowly becomes more human-like by having his metal innards replaced with artificial organs which work exactly like those of humans. A question which Riskin ponders in this essay, and which The Bicentennial Man asks as well, regards “which aspects of living creatures could be reproduced in machinery, and to what degree” (pg. 601). Is it possible to completely replicate the physical systems of animals and humans? Furthermore, is it possible to replicate the intelligence of animals and humans?

No one would say that a mechanical duck or flute player is a living being simply because of their ability to perform a few functions similar to living beings. However, what if these mechanical automata gained more abilities or more body parts resembling those of the living? Even though The Bicentennial Man had consciousness and physical organs, he was only recognized as a real man once he gained a blood equivalent, and with it, the ability to die. It seems, then, that consciousness is not the only criteria for one to be considered living. Paradoxically, one needs to die in order to be considered living.

A skeptic of the capabilities of automata said that he defies “all the machinists on earth to make an artificial face that expresses the passions, because to express the passions of the soul, one must have a soul” (pg. 631). It seems then that there is a limit to the beings which humans can create as we cannot place a soul inside of a mechanical system. Perhaps humans are deceived into the feeling that a mechanical being such as the flute player has a soul. It may feel for a moment as if it does. Because of this, watching a mechanical flute player produce music in a similar way to humans can be fascinating. People and animals are much more than mechanical systems, even if for a moment there is seemingly a deep connection between a person and an automaton.

Another question explored through the creation of the mechanical automata, is “the problem of whether human and animal functions were essentially mechanical” (pg. 601). Even if the physical functions of humans can be described as mechanical, humans still have a greater intelligence that is essential to their being. For example, an automaton created by Wolfgang von Kempelen known as the Turk, was able to play chess and carry out all of the mechanical movements required for the game. However, there is an indeterminate aspect of the game which requires intelligence. The chess playing Turk was only able to correct human mistakes and play chess against other people with the help of a human agent. This suggests the limit of a mechanical automaton to have human intelligence.

While mechanical automata can appear to be extremely lifelike, they are of course lacking the essence of a living being. They can be used to simulate real life and can seem very real in some sense. Mechanical systems can simulate a piece of a human, but never the whole. An automaton may simulate bodily functions or possess some resemblance of intelligence. However, there is something within humans which is far beyond their capabilities to simulate and that is the soul.


In The Cyborg Manifesto by Donna J. Haraway, transformations between natural beings and engineered systems are described as a metaphor for uniting all beings. Haraway writes that “we are living through a movement from an organic, industrial society to a polymorphous, information system” (pg. 28). The transformations that are described in the “Informatics of Domination” reveal a society in which the organic is replaced with the artificial. Natural reproduction becomes genetic engineering. Cooperation becomes enhanced communication. Labor becomes robotics. And the scariest of all is that mind becomes artificial intelligence. The description of humans and their bodies are systems which operate based on probability and statistics. The world of the cyborg removes any true uniqueness and individuality from human beings and essentially reduces them to computer systems. While the metaphor makes room for common ground among all beings, there is a loss of humanity with it. The fusion of machine, animal and human introduces a “confusion of boundaries” (pg. 35) in which there is a loss of identity for all groups and people.

Haraway continues by saying that “no objects, spaces, or bodies are sacred in themselves” (pg. 32). They are coded interfaces that operate based on statistics. The “translation of the world into a problem in coding” (pg. 34) reduces all struggle to problems of information. Emotions and other forces become invalidated as sources of conflict.

The idea of searching for a common language to solve these “problems of coding” cannot work because it is not possible to encode all cultures, languages, lifestyles into one set of code. Languages are not just forms of communication, rather they encompass cultures that have developed and evolved over many years and generations. To come up with a common language is to come up with a common culture, and perhaps lose aspects of specific cultures during that process. People and societies are more than coding projects. To model a society, let alone an entire world would be to reconstruct the forces at play which are beyond the comprehension of humans. Contrary to what is described, problems cannot all be reduced to the flow of information. Emotions are a valid source of conflict and have not yet been accurately encoded. If a common language and united system is not in fact possible, then the political divides between different groups cannot be completely bridged simply by removing identities in this way. But that is part of the political system in which we live. The struggle to understand others and create solutions that will foster a more united society is something that humans need to overcome organically.

The metaphor of the cyborg is interesting in that it brings up the conversation of the fluidity of identity and the struggle to resolve political and social struggles. However, there are some aspects of the theory which seem to conflict with humanity and the way people naturally behave. Even though the transformations which are inherent to the theory may also conflict with the nature of society, these paradoxes or “dualisms” are also inherent to the cyborg.


The question of essence always interests me because it is something people can sense but not necessarily understand. Some ideas discussed in Chapter 2 of Anatomy of a Robot by Despina Kakoudaki suggest new ways of understanding the essence of the self. To reiterate a point from my response to the Defecating Duck, the Bicentennial Man was not recognized as human until his perfectly crafted mechanical body obtained the ability to die. We see then that the essence of a person lies somewhere beyond the mechanical structure of the body. Somewhere beyond consciousness, intelligence, and even beyond emotion. Kakoudaki writes that “a body that remains immune to pain does not need to be consoled, and since it can be reconstructed perhaps it need not be missed or mourned” (pg. 70). Somehow, the value and the essence of a person lies in its vulnerability and immortality. If one tries to create an artificial being that can live forever, a paradox is introduced. If one lives forever they are not living because the consequence of living is dying. And if they cannot die then they never lived.

Kakoudaki says something interesting about consciousness, which is often seen as not only a human quality, but THE quality that makes one human. She writes that “the self is most honestly expressed when it is not altogether present as an acting self in the action” (pg 80). Is consciousness not a state of total presence and awareness of mind? Regardless, this statement suggests that people are most human when they let go of their most human quality. However, Kakoudaki explains that robots do exhibit consciousness as they are preprogrammed to carry out certain functions and are not present in doing so. However, I would argue that in order to be able to carry out a function mechanically, one would at some point need to be present in doing the function. After some time the function becomes second nature. Can the same consciousness be ascribed to a robot who never needed to learn something in order for it to become second nature? It seems to me that learning is the step which requires consciousness, something that a robot cannot truly accomplish.

If we can’t pinpoint the thing that makes a living being alive then we cannot recreate one. Then what is the value of automata and robots if we know that they do not or cannot possess the true essence of humans? Perhaps it is the concepts, which  we can better understand through the analogies put forth by these robots.

Kakoudaki says that mechanical bodies are based on the realities of organic bodies. We can’t simply reject the idea of a mechanical body as it is a concept drawn from organic bodies themselves. It allows us to understand the physical systems of the body as well as the limits in our abilities to recreate it. The question of the body and soul being one entity or two separate things can be explored through the construction of robots.

Mechanical beings and robots are intended to represent the ideal. They exhibit the most efficiency in working, processing and computing. However, efficiency is not necessarily ideal. Struggle, conflict and emotions, all things that robots lack, are inherent to the human condition and provide value to the work which humans produce.

These questions about life, consciousness and essence are important for the discussion of automata and robots. We can use the mechanical structure and function of robots to explore the relationship between humans, consciousness and life.

The idea that the widespread use of robots allows for a post-racial world is disputed in "Technoliberalism and Automation: Racial Imaginaries in a Postlabor World" by Atanasoski and Vora. The authors point out that the use of robots to do human work actually builds upon racialized and gendered labor in society. I was shocked to see Rastus the mechanical servant, a clear attempt at replacing human slaves with a mechanical figure without removing the racial element. Because the robot didn’t really have a soul and was not human one may argue that the fact that it could not rebel can be disregarded. Why does it matter if a machine can’t rebel? It is not human, it has no understanding of life. However, the issue is the relationship of the “master” to the robot. This servant machine represents how society couldn’t let go of the capitalist notion that someone should be subservient to you. Even though human slaves were emancipated it is as if white supremacists needed a replacement. No, the robot isn’t alive, but the white supremacist can imagine the robot is a person obeying his every order.

If the idea of robots wasn’t subservience, then why create bodies to do work rather than machines that do not appear human? The physical appearance naturally changes the way these types of robots are viewed. As an example, although it cannot move on its own, a smartphone has great computing power and capabilities greater than humans in some ways. A smartphone does exactly what a human tells it to do and it can talk. If this technology was in a human-looking form, would we see it as a slave which must be freed? It’s an interesting question to ponder. The way people interact with technology is based on its appearance rather than its function.

The technologies and automations that we have today are becoming increasingly advanced, although they are not yet as powerful and abundant as the robots described in “Rossum’s Universal Robots”. However, we can use this story (and that of “Runaround” by Isaac Asimov) as analogies of what may occur in the future. There are some robots that attempt to appear indistinguishable from humans (although in my opinion they are stuck in the uncanny valley). As we move closer to that reality, I wonder if it is possible to create a realistic looking robot that appears raceless and genderless. If the robot was made entirely of metal, then perhaps this is possible. Although facial features may still resemble a specific identity. But even more so, if robots come to possess skin, anatomy of a human and the ability to speak a language then decisions will need to be made for design of these elements. A skin tone, facial features, language and accent will all need to be part of a robot in order to truly appear human. The robot will then automatically appear outwardly as belonging to a specific race, gender and culture. Perhaps a neutral looking robot can be created that still looks human but I can’t imagine a genuinely looking person that doesn’t at least lean towards some identity. However, instead of eradicating all race and gender, perhaps equally representing many different identities is more ideal.

Atanasoski and Vora write that “This new generation of factory robots… take the human ‘out of the loop’ ” (pg. 27). As we see in R.U.R. we need to ensure that humans are always part of the equation. Humans and robots will need to correct the behaviors of one another as technology develops in order to strike a good equilibrium unlike the ones described in Asimov’s “Runaround”.


This reading brought up a lot of important points not only about the flaws in AI, but the flaws in the way people perceive AI. Technology, especially drones and AI, are "shaped by race" (pg. 143), allowing some to benefit from their subservience and others to be disposed of at their expense. The “fantasy of drone omniscience” (pg. 142) can and has led to the suffering of innocent people. I think this happens for two main reasons. One is because of the way data is collected and the second is because of the way technology is programmed. The danger is in the way that people may not necessarily be in tune to these realities.

Misconceptions of how advanced technology is in this moment can cause situations to turn deadly. The example given is the 2010 air strike where drones killed Afghan civilians who were mistaken for combatants. The biases of the people who programmed these drones were undoubtedly inherited by the drones during the air strike. When we leave technology unsupervised, it can misinterpret situations without being checked, leading to devastating outcomes. If AI will ever truly be autonomous, it is not currently at that stage. Furthermore, it was surveillance data that led to the murder of those civilians, which leads me to a question to ponder. Does surveillance make people feel safe or targeted? I think that this issue is racialized as well. The people in charge of overseeing surveillance technologies are in a position of power to point those technologies towards certain people and pass it off as the computer making decisions. The misconception of autonomous technology also removes the sense of responsibility from people. For example, I saw a Ted Talk about how a certain facial recognition software was unable to recognize faces with darker skin. One may assume that the computer simply made a mistake. However it is important to hold the people who created that software accountable. It may not have been intentional but that doesn’t remove the responsibility of those people to correct their mistake. Similarly in the air strike example when the AI misinterpreted certain actions as terrorist activity, it was likely not the computer making a mistake on its own. Rather, the people who programmed the surveillance AI included their biases as to what constitutes terrorist activity. Again, it was perhaps unintentional but that doesn’t remove the severe accountability. The deaths of those people are in the hands of the programmers and perhaps others involved in the process of giving responsibilities to drones.

The collection of data which informs drones (and other technologies) can easily become skewed and biased. The computer is only as smart as the data it is given. The computing capacity of a computer may be greater than that of a human, but a computer has no ability to gain completely new knowledge on its own. Biased historical data, biases in data collection, and the way humans can choose which parameters are important for decision making, are some ways that data can become racialized. Furthermore, reducing human information to quantitative mathematical formulas can further racialize data. When already racialized data is input to a mathematical model, the computer is forced to classify ambiguities to one side of a line when the line, in reality, isn’t so clear cut.

When working on machine learning models in classes I've taken we always discuss the biases and how to best minimize them so that the result of the model is as fair as possible. As an engineer it is important to understand how data is being collected and used in order to discern the truth. Furthermore, it is a machine learning model because it is not claiming to be the perfect truth and people should not interpret it as such. The result of models can serve as an estimation which can be used to make decisions in society. So when those estimations could have deadly results it is important to monitor technology and have several people with opposing/balanced biases to validate the decisions of the AI before it takes extreme action on its own. (People will always have biases so choosing which people should work together to monitor the decisions of AI is another issue, but the idea is that the decisions are not in the hands of a specific group of people.)

The bottom line is that drones do not decide to kill people. People program drones to kill people.As I was reading this chapter I was writing down notes as if I was reading about a science fiction world where the practice of preserving bodies for cryonics was just a hypothetical question to investigate. It wasn’t until halfway through the chapter that I realized Alcor is a real company and that people are really paying to preserve their bodies and brains. I was completely shocked that people actually do this. Besides for the fact that I find this practice to be morbid and inhumane, I was also surprised that people invest hundreds of thousands of dollars into the ambiguity of “future science”. There is no way to know whether or not scientists will be able to do anything with these bodies and brains in the future, yet people are investing in the possibility.

The company is attempting to solve “the problem of human mortality” as if mortality is threatening humanity. On the contrary, I think mortality is what makes someone a live human being. Mortality is the thing that separates humans from machines. Alcor’s main mode of preserving life seems to be the idea of uploading minds into machines. Even if that concept does one day succeed, and even if the same body comes alive again, is it the same person? Does the soul, whatever that may be, get preserved as well? The idea that minds will be uploaded assumes that the essence of a person lies within their brain.

We, as humans, can advance technology over time. However, we still have bounds and I think it is astounding that people believe they can overpower the natural order of the world. There must be a line between technology that threatens humanity and technology that enhances humanity. I agree with O'Connell's sentiment that cryonics is a “tactic for evading the fate that awaits us all” (pg. 33). I think people are subscribing to the false hope that they don’t have to let go of life when their time comes.


Mere Machines

Reading about a human-looking robot driving made me wonder about the difference between having a robot drive a car versus having an autonomous car. There is a new dimension introduced when a robot actually takes on human form. Is there a true need for humanoid robots or can we achieve all the same functions with machines that do not look like humans? For example, do we need a robot to walk or can we have a robot move on wheels and carry out the same end result? What is the benefit in replicating the organs and limbs of a human?

On another note, the idea that drones are a deadly form of technology is not wrong, however as I wrote in my last response, it is people who tell the drones what to do. People are essentially using drones as a weapon. Not that there is any justification for the murders that have taken place due to drones, but people would likely find other weapons to use if they were no longer using drones. It is the people that need to reform how they view others and how they use technology.

As for social bots, if there are eventually robots that can hug in a mechanically natural way, they still lack the comfort of a real human. I don’t think that people will feel an emotional connection to a robot in the same way people feel for another human. In order for robots to fill social roles people would need to feel comfortable with and see robots as equivalent social beings.
